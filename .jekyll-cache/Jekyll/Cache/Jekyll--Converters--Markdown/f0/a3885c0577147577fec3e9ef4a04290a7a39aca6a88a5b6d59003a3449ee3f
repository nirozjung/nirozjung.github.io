I"Ê<p>In March 2016, after completing my Masters, I went to visit NewYork. I got to know Sabina from her relative there. After coming back, we talked and we began exchanging about each others. I met her in London in May of 2017.</p>

<p>I went to Nepal after that and she also came to vist her family. I proposed her during that time and she
accepted it. I came back to Germany and ritual marriage ceremony was chosen to be on 2nd of September by the Jyotishi (Vedic Astrogler). 
I had to fly again to Nepal and got married. The process of getting married has lots of rituals which you can explore in the following links.</p>

<p>Here, we have all the links of our marriage video.</p>
