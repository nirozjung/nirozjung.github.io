                    <p> I changed my job to Nuremberg this year in February.
                        We were blessed with boy last year end of June and my heart is immersed in 
                        the purest form of Love that I cannot express. 
                        Life has changed, taking him on my lap gets me in world of eternal happiness and joy. 

                        Due to Corona crisis, I am under 'Shorttime Work' (Kurzarbeit) as my company introduced it.
                        Other than that, I am planning to explore more sides of Nuremberg and Frankonian Culture.

                    Lastly, never ending learning Software Design and Development!</p>

                    <p>Here is a quote from Bhagvad Gita that has profound effect on me.</p>

                    <blockquote cite="https://vaniquotes.org/wiki/By_Me,_in_My_unmanifested_form,_this_entire_universe_is_perva ded._All_beings_are_in_Me,_but_I_am_not_in_them">
                        By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. 
                        All beings are in Me, but I am not in them.
