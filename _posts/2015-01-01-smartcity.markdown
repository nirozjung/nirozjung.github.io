Smart home is a home where different home appliances connected over a home networkinteroperate intelligently in order to provide comfort, efficient control, convenience, se-curity,  services  and  reduce  energy  usage.   Several  home  automation  technologies  areemerging restricted to specific services and technologies.  Thus, homes today are hetero-geneous networks of such devices.Integration  of  such  home  networks  requires  a  middleware  platform  that  provides  anabstraction layer to these heterogeneous devices with multiple protocols for a unified userexperience.  Following the comparative analysis of open home automation middlewaresin terms of architecture, modularity, extendability and level of integration, ease of useand  configurability,  openHAB  was  found  to  be  more  hardware  and  protocol  agnosticand selected for deployment.A simple prototype Demo house aspiring to be smart was deployed with a heterogeneousnetworks of KNX infrastructure along with Enocean gateway,  Zigbee,  Z-wave and in-tegrated to perform a rule based automation on top of middleware platform openHABinstalled in an embedded Raspberry Pi.  Automation logic for controlling heating, cool-ing, lights based on presence at home was developed.  The data from sensors and deviceswere  persisted  in  embedded  MySQL  and  MongoDB  databases  for  further  purpose  of data analytics and machine learning

The demonstration of simple protype automating your house.
