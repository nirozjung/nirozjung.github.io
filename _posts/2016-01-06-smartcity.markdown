For the Green city

In Smart City, modern Technologies related with Energy, Mobility, City Planning, Administration and Communication is interlinked with each other so that the living quality of people uplifts and at the same time benefits the city. 
The term Smart City is difficult to define as its used from political background

Its been a lot of talks aroung the world about smart city but less has been understood. It's not only about automation and technologies incorporated in the modern infrastrucutres but rather conscience. Here conscience refers to emapthy. For example, a incident when I was riding my motorbike in Pokhara of Nepal, in zebra crossing a woman with her child was waiting alongside the road to cross but no one stopped to let her cross. I felt so annoyed that I was the only one stopping there and was asking for other vehicles to stop but it went all in vain . Everyone seems to be in rush although people say that we have life here being in the nature and mountains. This is the point that I realize development or smart city is not about high infrastructures but a conscience that every human head have. 

Emphasis has to be given in green and safe city rather than smart city in the context of Nepal. The recent earthquake has made us realize that the infrastructures we make should be resilient for sustainable development to mitigate such disaster in future. So, importance has to be given on resilient infrastructures and green city. Facing blackouts for more than 12 hours a day, huge emphasis on Solar energy has to be given. Green city no doubt has to be given utmost importance. Soceity should give huge respect to cyclists rather than motorist. 

1.  Energy (Smart Grid Technologies),
2.  Solar, 
3.  Earthquake Resistant and communication system during hazard situation
4.  More connectivity
5. Electric cars
6. Bicycles
7. Shared rides
8. Recycling Wase Managements 
9.  Mobility

Quality of air to be measured and if threshold reached, prompt action to be taken to discourage private vehicle users subsidizing and emphasizing to use public transportation. Until and unless public transportation improved, pollution wil rise as people tend to use private vehicles.
