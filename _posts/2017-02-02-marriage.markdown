In March 2016, after completing my Masters, I went to visit NewYork. I got to know Sabina from her relative there. After coming back, we talked and we began exchanging about each others. I met her in London in May of 2017. 

I went to Nepal after that and she also came to vist her family. I proposed her during that time and she
accepted it. I came back to Germany and ritual marriage ceremony was chosen to be on 2nd of September by the Jyotishi (Vedic Astrogler). 
I had to fly again to Nepal and got married. The process of getting married has lots of rituals which you can explore in the following links. 

Here, we have all the links of our marriage video.
