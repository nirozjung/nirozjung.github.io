Hey Whats up ! This is my first blogpost. I actually had a [portfolio][my-site] hosted in 1 und 1 server but later decided to go for opensource. After coming across jekyll, I decided to give up my portfolio website hosted commerically which will be terminated with end of this year. 

Life is so interesting, and so technologies changing everyday. Keeping your blogposts uptodate and writing something real and updating is kind of cumbersome work but however with the advent of 2017 I am determined to create some values within myself and try write creative stuffs from personal career growth to software technolgies. 

Well, there are lots of things to learn in life and I am continuosly struggling to find time admidst these distractions. I have several ways how I keep myself controlled in distractive social medias where you get everything what you want every momentary gratifications. 

One thing constantly triggers my mind, what and how can I add value to my society using technology and internet. I would be very much glad if people sharing common interests to shout at me and I will shout you back and wish to have a wonderful colloborative teamwork to create value within us, may it be in social entreprenurial or anything commerical to agriculture.
