Life is crazy and React is more crazy. In my meditation classes, many gurus said Please donot react as much as you can. 
But, learning about developing with React is so fun. Below are the resources that I used to learn the Front end development. 

- CSS and Bootstrap (Coursera)
- FreecodeCamp
- Javascript  (Javabrains)
- Typescript (Javabrains)
- React (Coursera)
