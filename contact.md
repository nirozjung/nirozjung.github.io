Other notes on emailing me
---------------------------

* Since I get lots of emails, I sweep it and can be missed out if I find its from unknown. Sorry for that. 

* Please do not write to me personally asking questions about ....

* I can only read email in English, German or Nepali .

* Please don't write asking me for advise about how to become a "hacker", or
"security researcher".

* I strongly prefer plaintext emails. If you send me an HTML-formatted message I
will still be viewing it as plaintext, and so I might be missing on some of the
extra information you put there, such as markings done with differently colored
fonts, etc.


Phone, Skype, etc.
===================

Since phonebased or video conversations lack technical clearity and depth, I prefer to communication over emails. I use Facetime and Google voice for conference calls.

It is also possible to engage with me in public conversations via:
