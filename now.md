What I am right now doing?

2015 was a year where I had a clear focus and consistency when I completed my Masters in Information Technology (quite stressful during final Maste thesis defense).
2016 was the year that I spent a lot travelling around Europe and America. 
2017 is well planned.

I try myself to work on my incomplete projects.

I am learning about software development everday
I’m (re-)learning German, listening to podcasts.

I am reading books Organized mind, Tibetan Tantric Buddhism, Social Skills for Developers, other Technological book related with Java and Functional Programming. 

I am learning Social Innovation on iversity MOOC.
I plan to learn Machine Learning, Spring MVC frameworks, RestWebServices, SOA during these weeks.

I plan to complete MBA course in Udemy which I registered end of Deecember 2016.

I plan for hitting gym regularly and make myself healthy. 

If my activities or priorities change, I’ll update this page. Last update was Feb 07, 2017.
